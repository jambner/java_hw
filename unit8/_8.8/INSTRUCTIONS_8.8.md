Write an application that allows a user to enter the names and birthdates of up to 10 friends. Continue to prompt the user for names and birthdates until the user enters the sentinel value ZZZ for a name or has entered 10 names, whichever comes first. When the user is finished entering names, produce a count of how many names were entered, and then display the names. In a loop, continuously ask the user to type one of the names and display the corresponding birthdate or "Sorry, no entry for name" if the name has not been previously entered. The loop continues until the user enters ZZZ for a name.

An example of the program is shown below:
