Write an application that determines whether the first two files are located in the same folder as the third one. The program should prompt the user to provide 3 filepaths. If the files are in the same folder display All files are in the same folder, otherwise display Files are not in the same folder.

Test the program when the files are in the same folder and when they are not. The following filepaths can be used to test your program:

/root/sandbox/TestData1.txt
/root/sandbox/TestData2.txt
/root/sandbox/TestData3.txt and /root/sandbox/test/TestData3.txt
