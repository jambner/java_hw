Create an application that contains an enumeration that represents the days of the week. Display a list of the days, and then prompt the user for a day. Display business hours for the chosen day. Assume that the business is open from 11 - 5 on Sunday, 9 - 9 on weekdays, and 10 - 6 on Saturday.

The program should accept input values in the format SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT.

An example of the program is shown below:

The days are:
SUN MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT

Enter the day code to find our hours >> MON
You entered MON
On MON our hours are 9 - 9
