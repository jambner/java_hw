Implement the BabyNameComparison application so that it prompts the user for three first names and concatenates them in every possible two-name combination so that new parents can easily compare them to find the most pleasing baby name.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter a name >> Sarah
Enter a second name >> Hannah
Enter a third name >> Grace
The combinations are:
Sarah Hannah
Sarah Grace
Hannah Sarah
Hannah Grace
Grace Sarah
Grace Hannah
